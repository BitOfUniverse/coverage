# Test Coverage Package (WIP)
Adds an overview of your current test coverage to Atom.

![coverage](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/philipgiuliani/coverage/master/screenshots/coverage_example.png)

## Installing
Use the Atom package manager, which can be found in the Settings view or run `apm install coverage` from the command line.

## Usage
The package is currently only working with the [simplecov](https://github.com/colszowka/simplecov) Ruby gem.
I will also support other coverage tools later.
You will need to add the following formatter to the simplecov gem: [simplecov-json](https://github.com/vicentllongo/simplecov-json).

The `coverage.json` file is expected to find in `coverage/coverage.json`.

## Support
If you wish to support this package and help further its development, feel free to tip via Gittip.
